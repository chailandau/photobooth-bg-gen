    "jobTitle": "Telepathic Sensor Tech",
    "bgDesc": "A delicate, lace-like network of neural interfaces and sensor arrays surrounds the empty workstation, as the soft, pulsing glow of brain-computer interfaces casts an ethereal light on the surrounding walls. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and the gentle hum of mental resonance, as the console whispers secrets of the cosmos in a language of pure thought. In the background, the curved, silver-blue bulk of the deep-space telescope looms, its instruments attuned to the whispers of distant stars."
