This is for generating backgrounds for the photobooth app.

The core logic is in /app/api/route.ts.

Its currently set up to handle future and past background images for the AI World Engineer Fair. Just uncomment one vs the other to get the right prompting etc.

Simple to use for future photobooths too!
